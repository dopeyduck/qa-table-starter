# qa-table-starter
A bash script for exporting genealogical data from the open-cbgm for creating a quantitative analysis table.

This script presupposes that the user has already populated a database with collation information. For a tutorial of the open-cbgm, see https://github.com/jjmccollum/open-cbgm-standalone. Joey's GitHub contains very detailed instructions for using the software. There is also Joeyâ€™s illustrated crash course, https://www.academia.edu/43490548/The_CBGM_An_Illustrated_Crash_Course_Supplement_to_The_open_cbgm_Library_Design_and_Demonstration_.
